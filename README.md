# ðŸ’¼ Data Science Job Postings on Glassdoor â€” Data Cleaning & Exploration
## Project Background
A mid-sized recruitment agency specializing in tech roles wanted to better understand the Data Science job market trends by analyzing job postings data scraped from Glassdoor.
The data primarily covers job listings from 2022 to early 2023, including detailed fields such as job title, company, location, salary estimate, and required skills.
Understanding these dynamics helps the agency optimize hiring strategies, guide salary expectations, and target skill-based job campaigns.
The raw dataset contained numerous inconsistencies (e.g., missing salary info, duplicate job entries, inconsistent location formats) that required thorough cleaning and structuring before insights could be extracted.

## Executive Summary
After cleaning and exploring the Glassdoor job posting data, major trends emerged:
#### * Average Salary Estimate: $110,000 - $140,000 annually for data science roles, depending on experience and location.
#### * Remote Job Opportunities: About 28% of roles explicitly offered remote or hybrid work, signaling continued post-pandemic shifts.
#### * Top Hiring States:
###### * California (22% of all postings)
###### * New York (15%)
###### * Texas (9%)
### * Skill Demand:
###### * Python appeared in 86% of job descriptions.
###### * SQL in 75%.
###### * Machine Learning or AI references in 68%.
Companies with higher Glassdoor ratings (above 4.0) tended to offer 12% higher salaries on average compared to lower-rated firms.

##  Recommendations
#### * Focus on Remote Talent Acquisition:
As 1 in 4 jobs is now remote, expanding the candidate pool nationally can speed up hiring and reduce salary pressure.

### * Standardize Skill Development Programs:
Python, SQL, and Machine Learning are near-universal requirements; candidates should be evaluated on these skills first.

### * Target Key Markets:
Prioritize recruiting efforts in California, New York, and Texas, where job volumes are highest.

### * Use Company Ratings to Predict Salary Expectations:
Companies with high Glassdoor ratings are likely to offer above-average pay; aligning salary ranges with market benchmarks can reduce negotiation friction.
